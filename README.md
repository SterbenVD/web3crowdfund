# Just a web3 crowdfunding site

Built backend using thirdweb framework. Used Solidity to code the smartcontract.

Deployed it on sepolia test network because Goerli requires 0.01 eth on mainnet :(

Built frontend using thirdweb framework with ReactJS and TailwindCSS.

# How to run?

Run `npm run dev` in frontend folder to run the frontend. 

The backend is essentially a smart contract hosted on the sepolia testnet, so no setup is required.
